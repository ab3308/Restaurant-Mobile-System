ABOUT
-----------------------

- This project was created with a small introduction and limited knowledge of Android app development (Java).
- The aim was to create an application that could be used in a restaurant or similar setting, where
  orders are taken and subsequently stock levels are affected. 
- Furthermore, staff needed to be able to see available tables to speed up the seating process.
- At the time the stakeholder was a local restaurant where I worked.

EVALUATION
-----------------------

- Given the limited knowledge going into the project, it carries out the core functonality, which makes the project a success.
- However, for large parts the code is very inefficient and lots of it is reused or redundant.
- A future re-implementation would significantly optimise the code while improving and adding functionality.
  For example, the ability to set up tabs or connect orders to a printer on the network such that 
  kitchen cheques are printed upon sending.
